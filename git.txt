       The mandatory field for man is build reputation, achievement ,goals ,strong portfolio for them life but most of the men are failed to reach in the genz generation all are finding way of happiness and some fucking things . First things to do in our days is one good basic routine like workout , yoga , reading the books , writing journal in your life's ,cycling etc.., there are many things to explore in the world .

        All are thinking life is written by god , but god i doing making us not create our problems so live your life guys . In the modern days people were lazy , so we declare the laziness put the alarm your correct time e.g. 5.00 clock wake up at the time don't cut off the alarm that early stage we lose again and again the whole day guys understand this point, because I'm facing that hard times.
